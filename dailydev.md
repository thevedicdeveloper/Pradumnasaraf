**Feedback**

- Instead of [Markdown supported]() text, a Markdown logo can be used. Something like this

- Instead of having two buttons, one for adding comments and one for viewing all the comments, I would like a single button, in which I can comment and view old comments at the same time (Scroll.)

- Even though images and GIFs are supported there is no place it is mentioned and an easy way to add them. I have generated a hyperlink, Something like this can be added

- While commenting having old comments is great, something which we scroll. Also it's not very likely first I go in `Open Summary` and see old comments and come back here again to add my comment
